To set up:

You must create a file 'watchyou.properties' in your (java) home directory.
This file should be of the following template:

	# Where to save all the captured .sniffed files
	outputdir=/home/root/workspace/
	
	# the unique id of the device to capture on
	capture.device=wlan0
	
	# where to point the browser to as a proxy
	proxy.host=localhost
	proxy.port=8888
